reduce() outputs a collection which does not add to the directed acyclic graph (DAG) 
so is implemented as an action. Because once the collection is returned, 
we know no longer refer to it as an RDD which is the basic dataset unit in spark. However, 
reduceByKey() returns an RDD which is just another level/state in the DAG, therefore is a transformation.



reduce() is a function that operates on an RDD of objects while reduceByKey() is a function that 
operates on an RDD of key-value pairs. To put it more technically, reduce() function is a member of RDD[T] 
class while reduceByKey() is a member of the PairRDDFunctions[K, V] class.
